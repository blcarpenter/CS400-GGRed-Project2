4. PokemonDataReader.java - reads in the data file given
5. DataWranglerTester.java - tested all these methods to ensure they worked efficiently

Additional Contributions:

I tested my own material to ensure it was all working, and then at the end, I downloaded everyone's files to ensure 
they all worked together.
